Q：n皇后问题，皇后走的是「米」字，问你在k * k的棋盘上能放几个互不攻击的皇后
A：先放第一行，然后递归到下一行，更新每一行的状态。
你可以参考一下Guide to Competitive Programming 2nd edition第18页对backtracking解释。

A backtracking algorithm begins with an empty solution and extends the solution step by step. 
The search recursively goes through all different ways how a solution can be constructed
As an example, consider the problem of calculating the number of ways n queens can be placed 
on an n × n chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. 
For example, Fig.2.2 shows the two possible solutions for n = 4.
The problem can be solved using backtracking by placing queens on the board row by row. 
More precisely, exactly one queen will be placed on each row 
so that no queen attacks any of the queens placed before. 
A solution has been found when all n queens have been placed on the board.
For example, Fig.2.3 shows some partial solutions generated by the backtracking algorithm when n = 4. 
At the bottom level, the three ﬁrst conﬁgurations are illegal, because the queens attack each other. 
However, the fourth conﬁguration is valid, and it can be extended to a complete solution by placing two more queens on the board.
There is only one way to place the two remaining queens.
